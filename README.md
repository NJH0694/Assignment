This project consists total 7 files:

#01 Conversion.R

Call file 02 and 03 to convert raw data to csv files.

#02 Read.R

Read xml raw files from '/Raw Data/' and stores important data

#03 Tidy.R

Subsetting dataframe and write into '/Tidy Data/' folder

#04 Combine.R

Read all csv files from '/Tidy Data' and combine into a single database file.

#05 Preparation.R

Read database file again and transform data based on defect type

#06 Visualize.R

Plot graphs using ggplot to visualize relationship between defects and variables

#07 DescriptiveAnalysis.R

Identify correlationship between variables by using descriptive analysis such as t.test and ANOVA
